# Second Order Differential Equation Phase Plane Visualization

Simple numerical approach to solving a given second order differential equation.

# Notes

In the input window use symbol x as x(t) and symbol x_d as x'(t).
For example to show solution to: x(t)''+2x(t)'+3x(t)=sin(x(t))
insert: -2*x_d-3*x-Math.sin(x) to the input window, then click set and finally play to start the animation.
